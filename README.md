# Exploring-Movie-Reccomendation-dataset
Performong the statistical analysis of the two datasets given. Your analysis should provide as much information as possible. You must use all the related information of users and movies for the analysis i.e. rating, user (age group, zipcode etc) and item(genre, title, release date etc). The grading of this task depends on the useful information extracted from the given dataset, which can help in the learning process. The dataset:
â€¢ movielens 100k dataset, Rating prediction dataset (rating scale 1-5). Available at: http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/

In this dataset, I explored the movie dataset and try to see how each data affected the ratings of different classes and I was able to discover some trends and also made suggestions for target group incases of advertisement.

The Other part of this project was to use Matrix factorization for recommender systems and implementing stochastic gradient descent to find best values hyperparameters and then comparing the RMSE with the NMF module from SKlearn.
